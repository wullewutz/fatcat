# fatcat - Kalis kitten's weight analysis

## The Story

During early spring 2019 our young cat Kali started behaving strange and was gaining weight quickly.
The dialog at our vet by that time could be summarized as follows:

Vet: Well, the cat is pregnant.

We: But she is castrated!

Vet: Really? That's rare, but happens, if not done properly. Who did the surgery?

We: It was done here...

Vet: ...

So, a few weeks later in the heat of summer 2019, four cute kittens were given birth by Kali.

## The Data

Since you should weigh young kittens regularly to check their health and I really love big-fat data,
I decided to keep the weights of each kitten in a .csv file and analyze and plot it using
python, pandas and matplotlib. Since this started as a private-only repository, you will find
some German commit messages among the early commits - sorry!

Also note, that it was not possible to weight every kitten every day.
I interpolated those days manually, but unfortunately not marked it in the raw data. Sorry for that as well.
